//! [`Screen`] — a self-managing terminal application facade.
//!
//! `Screen<I, O>` bundles the three primitives a full-screen terminal
//! program needs into one owned handle:
//!
//! - a [`Terminal`] for the raw-mode lifecycle,
//! - a cell-diff renderer, and
//! - an [`EventSource`] for decoded input (read synchronously).
//!
//! It additionally owns the non-render terminal/input modes (mouse,
//! bracketed paste, focus reporting, in-band resize, the default
//! foreground/background/cursor colors, the window title, the cursor
//! style, and color-scheme update reports) and tracks them so they can be
//! torn down on a shell handoff and re-applied afterwards.
//!
//! Construction is inert: [`Screen::new`] (and the [`stdio`](Screen::stdio)
//! / [`open`](Screen::open) shortcuts) only build the screen. Begin a
//! session with [`Screen::init`], which enters raw mode and sends the
//! capability queries. Teardown is explicit: there is **no** `Drop`.
//! Hand the terminal back to the shell with [`Screen::finish`] (consume),
//! [`Screen::pause`] (keep, e.g. to shell out), or [`Screen::suspend`]
//! (pause, then stop the process with `SIGTSTP`); resume a
//! paused/suspended screen with [`Screen::resume`].
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use uncurses::screen::Screen;
//! use uncurses::style::Style;
//! use uncurses::text::TextSurface;
//!
//! # fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
//! let mut screen = Screen::open()?; // build over /dev/tty
//! screen.init()?; // raw mode + capability queries
//! screen.enter_alt_screen()?;
//! screen.set_str((0, 0), "hello", Style::default());
//! screen.render()?;
//! let event = screen.read_event()?;
//! screen.observe_event(&event)?; // keep capability tracking alive
//! screen.finish()?; // restore the terminal
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Inline and fullscreen
//!
//! With the alternate screen on (after [`enter_alt_screen`](Screen::enter_alt_screen))
//! the managed area is the whole terminal viewport, addressed with absolute
//! moves. Without it (the default) the screen is *inline*: it occupies the
//! full terminal width but only as many rows as you draw, anchored in the
//! normal buffer so scrollback above and the returning shell prompt below
//! stay intact. Set the inline height with [`resize`](Screen::resize), and
//! push lines into the scrollback above the surface with
//! [`insert_above`](Screen::insert_above). Call
//! [`autoresize`](Screen::autoresize) to refit to the current window.
//!
//! ```text
//!  Inline (default): the surface lives in the normal buffer, only as
//!  many rows as you draw; scrollback and the shell prompt stay intact.
//!
//!    $ earlier shell output
//!    $ ... scrollback ...
//!    ┌─────────────────────────┐
//!    │ managed surface         │  <- only the rows you draw, full width
//!    └─────────────────────────┘
//!    $ shell prompt resumes
//!
//!  Fullscreen (after enter_alt_screen): the whole viewport is the
//!  surface, addressed with absolute moves, and restored on exit.
//!
//!    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
//!    │                             │
//!    │  the whole terminal         │
//!    │  viewport is the surface    │
//!    │                             │
//!    └─────────────────────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! # Options and defaults
//!
//! [`init`](Screen::init) uses [`ScreenOptions::default`];
//! [`init_with`](Screen::init_with) takes an explicit [`ScreenOptions`] to
//! choose the desired keyboard enhancements, whether to enable mouse
//! tracking at startup, and the in-band-resize and pixel-size behaviors.
//! Always-on defaults (such as bracketed paste) take effect immediately;
//! discovery-driven defaults are applied once the terminal answers the
//! capability queries (see [`capabilities`](Screen::capabilities)).
//!
