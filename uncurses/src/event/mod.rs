//! Terminal events and event-stream decoding.
//!
//! This module owns the core [`Event`] enum together with the
//! internal decoder that parses raw terminal bytes into events, the
//! platform-specific [`EventSource`] that drives the decoder from a
//! tty, and the key/mouse types that events carry.
//!
//! ## The decode pipeline
//!
//! Input arrives as a raw byte stream. The source reads bytes (waking on a
//! self-pipe so another thread can interrupt a blocking read), feeds them to
//! the decoder, and hands back fully-formed [`Event`] values. Escape
//! sequences may straddle reads, so the decoder buffers partial input and a
//! short timeout disambiguates a lone `Esc` key from the start of a CSI/SS3
//! sequence.
//!
//! ```text
//!   tty input        EventSource              Decoder            caller
//!   ─────────        ───────────              ───────            ──────
//!   bytes  ───────▶  read + buffer  ───────▶  scan sequences ─▶  Event
//!     │                   ▲                        │
//!     │                   └── Esc-timeout ◀────────┘ (Esc key vs CSI/SS3?)
//!     └── self-pipe wake ─┘  (interrupt a blocking read from another thread)
//! ```
//!
//! Build an [`EventSource`] over a terminal's input half and read typed
//! events in a loop. Keys parse from strings and compare by canonical
//! chord, so matching a shortcut is plain equality.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use uncurses::event::{Event, EventSource, Key};
//! use uncurses::terminal::Terminal;
//!
//! # fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
//! let mut term = Terminal::stdio();
//! term.make_raw()?;
//! let mut events = EventSource::new(term.input())?;
//!
//! let quit: Key = "ctrl+c".parse().unwrap();
//! loop {
//!     match events.read()? {
//!         Event::KeyPress(ref k) if *k == quit => break,
//!         Event::KeyPress(k) => { let _ = k.code; }
//!         Event::Resize(ws) => { let _ = (ws.col, ws.row); }
//!         _ => {}
//!     }
//! }
//! term.restore()
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Queries
//!
//! To ask the terminal a question (its background color, cell size,
//! device attributes, and so on), write the request bytes from the
//! [`ansi`](crate::ansi) module to the output and read the matching reply
//! event back through the same source. The
//! [`Screen`](crate::screen::Screen) facade wraps this in `request_*` methods
//! whose replies surface as ordinary events, never swallowing the user's
//! keystrokes in between.
//!
//! ## Async
//!
//! With the `async` feature, `EventStream` reads the same events through a
//! [`futures_core::Stream`], so the loop becomes `while let Some(ev) =
//! stream.next().await`.
//!
//! [`futures_core::Stream`]: https://docs.rs/futures-core/latest/futures_core/stream/trait.Stream.html
